# nextjs-starter-preact-tailwindcss

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter project coming with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) built-in.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Visual Studio Code

From my experience Tailwind CSS works best with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), so you might want to install the following extensions:

- [vscode-stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Also make sure you locally disable any interfering extensions (i.e. SCSS Formatter) in your workspace.
